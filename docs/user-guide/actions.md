## App

Launch an app.

## App shortcut

Launch an app shortcut. This is a great way to add more functionality to Key Mapper.

## Key code

--8<-- "requires-key-mapper-keyboard-or-shizuku.md"

Input a simple key event with this key code.

## Key

--8<-- "requires-key-mapper-keyboard.md"

This is a shortcut for creating a key code action if you aren't sure what the key code of a button that you have is.

## Tap screen (2.1.0+, Android 7.0+)

This will tap a point on your screen.

!!! warning
    Android restricts what apps can do with this so you won't be able to tap the screen at the same time as Key Mapper and Key Mapper can't tap multiple places at once.

## Key event (2.1.0+)

--8<-- "requires-key-mapper-keyboard-or-shizuku.md"

This will input a more complicated key event than the simple key code action.

## Text

--8<-- "requires-key-mapper-keyboard.md"

This will input any text that you want.

## Intent (2.3.0+)

This is a way to communicate with other apps, especially automation apps because they often have a way to trigger their own actions from an intent.

Read about intents in the Android SDK documentation [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent).

## Phone call (2.3.0+)

This will start calling the number that you put.

## Sound (2.4.0+)

This action will play a sound. Key Mapper will copy the sound file to its own folder, which means you won't have to worry about losing them. Key Mapper will only play one sound at a time and the sound will play forever until it stops or you pause your key maps. Your sounds will be backed up and restored with your key maps as well.
